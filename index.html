A cry, an appeal, came to me from the city, a few days since, after this wise: Our young men are going to destruction, and we want your influence, counsel, and prayers, to help save them.In New London, report says, the young men are falling into drinking habits as never before. So in New Haven, Bridgeport, and the other cities and large places of the state.</p>";
